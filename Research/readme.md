##Style of game
### What the game could look like including colour schemes, art styles, different potential characters and menu and text screens.

-For the game we could use bright friendly colours throughout the game. The fox could be quite a bright soft orange and the forest could be soft colours throughout the seasons. Sprint and summer soft greens for plants, light browns and light blue for sky and for autunm and winter soft browns and white for snow to create friendly positive enviornments.

-With the colour scheme also contrasting colours for goals and objectives so they are clear to a player because we have a young audience to make it clear what their goal is and help guide them to success without it feeling like they are being forced along a certian path to the goal.

-For the art style I think the character and in game objects throughout the game should be cartoonish and sharp harsh edges should be limited. This will make the game friendly for a younger audience and make the game appear less threatening to a young player making them more confident in exploring.


##Themes to potenitally tackle in game
###Different themes which could be looked at and how we could icnlude them in the game

-One theme which is very relevant to a younger audience is being scared of the dark. This theme could be introduced into the game in a way which helps users get over any fears they have of the dark. The game could contain dark segments in it which users have to overcome it by traveling through it. The can could be resassuring showing there is nothing to be scared of by doing so and when they overcome the darkness they could be appluaded in someway. Having a secondary character get over a fear of the dark throughout the game could also help show the player empathy as they are getting over the fear with another charcter.

-Having other characters in the game while users play who interacts with them could also be useful. Teaching users social skills and helping a target audience who are forming relationships with people for the first time. The character could give help and support and talk generally to the player throughout.
