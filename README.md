##Basic Setup
Our project is set up in Visual Studios and we are using the SDL library with C++. The first step was setting up our base programme so that the libraries and project settings were suited to this.

##First Pair Programming Session - Sprite render
###Task completed by: Thomas, Sam, Dean (Pair programming)
We approached this first user story as a group and worked around Thomas' laptop. This meant that we were all able to see what was needed and could each input into the code. This was useful as none of use said we were confident in C++ and it would help us to communicate as a group to do as much pair programming as possible.

The user story that we wanted to focus on was to have a basic sprite render on screen. We already had a window that opened up with a black background and a quit function that meant the player could press the red cross to close the project. The main challenge we had with this was that we had initially setup our libraries incorrectly and needed to download SDL2_image-2.0.4 to support our image load. After we did this, we were able to use a sprite to display on screen which represented the character.
