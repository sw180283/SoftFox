##Basic Setup
Our project is set up in Visual Studios and we are using the SDL library with C++. The first step was setting up our base programme so that the libraries and project settings were suited to this.

##Week 1 - First Pair Programming Session - Sprite render
###Task completed by: Thomas, Sam, Dean (Pair programming)
We approached this first user story as a group and worked around Thomas' laptop. This meant that we were all able to see what was needed and could each input into the code. This was useful as none of us said we were confident in C++ and it would help us to communicate as a group to do as much pair programming as possible.

The user story that we wanted to focus on was to have a basic sprite render on screen. We already had a window that opened up with a black background and a quit function that meant the player could press the red cross to close the project. The main challenge we had with this was that we had initially setup our libraries incorrectly and needed to download SDL2_image-2.0.4 to support our image load. After we did this, we were able to use a sprite to display on screen which represented the character.

##Week 2 - Second Pair Programming Session - Move character around screen, render platforms on screen, change sprite to fox
###Task completed by: Thomas, Sam (Pair programming)
In this session, we started to implement code to move the character around the screen. At the moment, the character can move in all directions, however in the final game we only require left and right movement with the jump replacing the up movement and gravity replacing the down movement.

We also were able to implement platformer rendering and started to build the design for our game. We encountered an error with our Visual Studios program, that was resolved by deleting the Debug folder. This caused frustration during this session as we were getting inconsistent errors.

Finally, we were able to change the image of the player sprite to give more idea of the intended aesthetic.

##The First Sprint Review
There was some issues raised with our layout of our trello board, such as using labels to respresent our members. It was suggested by our "Product manager" to use the members functions of Trello and instead use the labels for a way to represent the tasks. Therefore, we have created labels for: programming, design, art and research.

Another suggestion was to prioritise our trello backlog with the user stories are most needed for our game to be at the top. We have found this to be useful in seeing which areas of our project we need to approach next.

We were also recommened to start our self, group and peer evaulation in private documents to document our progress. A suggested method was Post-mortum which looks at some achievements which we were proud of, and some areas of improvement.

The overall, we feel this sprint went well as we achieved all but one of our intended user stories. For improvement, Github branches could have been used more to make sure we always have a working master with separate branches to have work in progress user stories.
